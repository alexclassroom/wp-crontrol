# WP Crontrol

WP Crontrol enables you to take control of the scheduled cron events on your WordPress website or WooCommerce store. From the admin screens you can:

 * View all scheduled cron events along with their arguments, schedule, callback functions, and when they are next due.
 * Edit, delete, pause, resume, and immediately run cron events.
 * Add new cron events.
 * Bulk delete cron events.
 * Add and remove custom cron schedules.
 * Export and download cron event lists as a CSV file.

WP Crontrol is aware of timezones, will alert you to events that have no actions or that have missed their schedule, and will show you a helpful warning message if it detects any problems with your cron system.

## Usage

1. Go to the `Tools → Cron Events` menu to manage cron events.
2. Go to the `Settings → Cron Schedules` menu to manage cron schedules.
