# Privacy statements

## WP Crontrol plugin privacy statement

The WP Crontrol plugin is private by default and always will be. It does not send data to any third party, nor does it include any third party resources. It makes no use of HTTP cookies or client-side storage technology. It makes no use of personally identifiable information (PII).

I have high confidence that WP Crontrol has no impact on the GDPR or CCPA compliance of your site, although I cannot guarantee it.

If you need to maintain a historical log of changes to cron events and schedules then the excellent [Simple History plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-history/) has built-in support for logging actions performed via WP Crontrol.

Please note that in a future version of WP Crontrol, an opt-in feature may be introduced which allows you to choose to log the outcome of cron events as they run, persistently store the logs, and/or optionally send the logs to a third party service. Such features will only ever be opt-in.

## wp-crontrol.com website privacy statement

* The wp-crontrol.com website is operated by [John Blackbourn](/docs/about/).
* The wp-crontrol.com website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
